###...an iphone app to make things like memes and other funnies.


Viral Content Generator is an iPhone app made with Jquery Mobile, Codiqa and PhoneGap.
It was an exploration into how to rapidly create an iPhone app using html and css.

We found plenty great shortcuts, but also many shortcomings (Codiqa being the most salient bottleneck).

That said, PhoneGap is amazing!

Known issues:
1. Cannot hide scrolling without preventing horizontal scrolling...so you will always see that elastic scroll effect
2. Back and forward buttons do not clean up and reset data correctly sometimes. Results in repeated/leftover images.
3. Much of the functionality is not there; our purpose was to create a full front-end and only a scaffold backend.
